        <h1 class="text-5xl font-obritron font-bold">Application Guide</h1>

        <p class="mt-6 text-xl">
            This guide provides step-by-step instructions for using the Centerlock Refresh Kit.
            Follow each step carefully, ensuring you have all necessary tools and materials ready before starting.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl">
            Before you begin, please ensure you have read the <a href="disclaimer.html"
                class="text-blue-500 underline">disclaimer</a>.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12">Step 1: Gather Materials</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Before you begin, ensure you have the following items from the Centerlock Refresh Kit:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
            <li>4x Decals for the outer rim of the centerlock nut</li>
            <li>4x spline masks</li>
            <li>4x center cap masks</li>
            <li>4x alternate center cap masks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You may also want to have the following items on hand (not included in the kit):
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
            <li>Rubberised Paint for the toothed spline part of the centerlock nut (eg. PlastiDip)</li>
            <li>An alcohol wipe for ensuring the surface is clean</li>
            <li>Gloves</li>
            <li>A toothpick</li>
            <li>Pencil or drywipe marker</li>
            <li>Rag/Newspaper/Other to protect the rest of the wheel</li>

        </ul>



        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12">Step 2: Cleaning</h2>

        <p>
            Ensure the surface of the centerlock nut is clean and dry. Ideally, use an alcohol wipe to remove any hidden dirt or grease.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12">Step 3: Masking the toothed spline</h2>
        <div class="font-semibold opacity-40">If you want to paint the toothed spline part of the centerlock nut.</div>

        <p>
            Use the spline masks fitted around the the toothed spline part of the centerlock nut. This will protect it
            from paint
            during the application process.
            Ensure the mask is applied evenly and securely to prevent any paint from seeping through.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12">Step 4: Masking the center cap</h2>
        <div class="font-semibold opacity-40">If you want to paint the toothed spline part of the centerlock nut.</div>
        <p>
            There are two types of center cap masks in the kit. Use one that either covers the whole cap, or just the
            Porsche emblem, if you want to refinish the center cap at the same time.

        </p>

        <div class="flex gap-4 mt-6">
            <img src="img/guide/cap-mask-1.jpg" alt="Center Cap Mask" class="w-1/2">
            <img src="img/guide/cap-mask-2.jpg" alt="Alternate Center Cap Mask" class="w-1/2">
        </div>



        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12">Step 5: Masking the rest of the wheel</h2>
        <div class="font-semibold opacity-40">If you want to paint the toothed spline part of the centerlock nut.</div>
        <p>
            It's highly recommended to protect the rest of the wheel from paint. Use a rag, newspaper, or other material
            to cover the exposed areas betwen the centerlock nut and the tyre.
            This will prevent any accidental overspray.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12">Step 6: Paint the toothed spline</h2>
        <div class="font-semibold opacity-40">If you want to paint the toothed spline part of the centerlock nut.</div>
        <p>
            At this point you're ready to paint the toothed spline part of the centerlock nut.
        </p>

        <p>
            The best type of paint is rubberised paint such as <a class="text-blue-500 underline" target="_Blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/PLASTIDIP-PLASTI-PLASTIC-RUBBER-AEROSOL/dp/B06WVLGGQV/">PlastiDip</a>. It's durable, flexible, but also removable if required.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's recommented to apply 2-3 thin coats of paint, allowing 30 minutes between each coat for optimal
            adhesion and finish.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's a good idea to do this in a garage, or on a still, dry day, with low wind and no rain for
            at least 4 hours
        </p>


        <img src="img/guide/painted.jpg" alt="Paint" class="w-full mt-4">


        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12">Step 6: Remove the masks</h2>
        <div class="font-semibold opacity-40">If you want to paint the toothed spline part of the centerlock nut.</div>
        <p>
            After the final coat (but before the paint is fully dry), carefully remove the spline masks and center cap
            masks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Gently pull the spline mask towards you in a smooth, careful motion, being careful not to smudge the wet
            paint.
        </p>

        <p>
            Use the toothpick to carefully lift the edges of the center cap mask, then pull it off gently.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's a good idea to carefully run the toothpick around the edge of the center cap to ensure the rubberised
            paint doesn't bridge the gap between the cap and outer toothed spline.
        </p>

        <p>
            If there is any unwanted paint on the center cap, you can gently dab it off by wrapping the toothpick
            in an alcohol wipe.
        </p>

        <p>
            Allow the paint to dry fully (4-6 hours).
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12">Step 6: Marking up decal position</h2>

        <p>
            Using the existing markings on the centerlock nut, use a pencil or drywipe marker to discreetly mark the
            'stop'
            position on the wheel (you'll wipe this off later)
        </p>

        <img src="img/guide/stop-position.jpg" alt="Marking the Decal Position" class="w-full mt-4">


        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12">Step 7: Apply the outer decal</h2>

        <p>
            Once the paint is fully dry, you can apply the outer decal to the centerlock nut.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ensure the surface is still clean, dry and free from dust or debris.
        </p>

        <p>
            Gently peel the decal from its backing and position it carefully on the outer rim of the centerlock nut,
            ensuring the 'stop' position aligns with the mark you made earlier.
        </p>

        <p>
            Press down firmly to ensure the decal adheres well, smoothing out any bubbles or wrinkles as you go.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, wipe off the pencil or drywipe marker mark you made earlier.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold">
            Your centerlock nut should now look fantastic again and is ready to enjoy.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12">Aftercare</h2>


        <p>
            Taking care of your refreshed centerlock nuts is essential for maintaining their appearance.
            Here are some tips for aftercare:
        </p>


        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
            <li>Avoid directly applying harsh cleaning agents to the refreshed centerlock nut.</li>
            <li>Do not use a pressure washer / jet wash on the centerlock nut.</li>
            <li>It's likely that if you have to remove the wheel, the rubberised paint will get damaged. Mitigate this
                by using electrical tape around the toothed spline, before putting the centerlock removal tool on.</li>
        </ul>
