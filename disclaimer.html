        <h3>User Guidance</h3>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p>Work in a well-ventilated area. Wear old clothes - the paint
            may stain permanently.</p>
        <p>Ensure the wheels are cool to the touch and clean. Use the alcohol wipe provided to clean all surfaces before
            applying decals or paint.</p>

        <h4>Masking & Painting</h4>
        <p>Use the spline masks to protect the wheel while spraying the toothed part of the centerlock nut.</p>
        <p>The rubberised paint  
            contains synthetic rubber, organic solvents (such as toluene, xylene, and n-hexane), plasticizers, resins, stabilizers, and pigments. These ingredients provide flexibility, adhesion, and color but may be flammable and harmful if inhaled. Use in a well-ventilated area and avoid prolonged exposure
        </p>
        <p>Cover adjacent bodywork and wheels to avoid overspray. Allow at least 24
                hours for the paint to fully cure before handling or driving.</p>

        <h4>Decal Application</h4>
        <p>Ensure surfaces are completely dry. </p>
        <p>The decals are heavy duty 12-mil Polyvinyl Chloride with a Glossy UV PET for added durability and weather resistance. They are designed for used in harsh conditions. Apply with care to avoid
            lifting or misalignment.</p>

        <h3>🔁 Replacements & Support</h3>
